You‚Äôre absolutely right üëç The **Index had 18 sections**, so the **Interview-Focused Q\&A** (section 20) should feel a bit more comprehensive than just 15 questions. Let‚Äôs expand it properly to around **25‚Äì30 solid interview questions** ‚Äî short, sharp, and complete.

# **20. Interview-Focused Questions (Q\&A)**

---

### **Q1. What is Node.js and why is it popular?**

**A:** Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on **V8 engine**, known for its **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model**. Popular because of speed, scalability, and using JS for both frontend & backend.

---

### **Q2. How does the Event Loop work in Node.js?**

**A:** The **event loop** manages async tasks in phases (timers ‚Üí pending callbacks ‚Üí idle ‚Üí poll ‚Üí check ‚Üí close). It enables concurrency on a single thread.

---

### **Q3. Process vs Thread in Node.js?**

**A:**

* **Process**: independent memory space.
* **Thread**: lightweight, within a process.
* Node runs JS in a **single thread**, but libuv uses worker threads for async tasks.

---

### **Q4. What are Streams in Node.js?**

**A:** Streams process **data in chunks**. Types: **Readable**, **Writable**, **Duplex**, **Transform**. Useful for large files, sockets, video streaming.

---

### **Q5. Explain Middleware in Express.js.**

**A:** Middleware are functions executed between request and response. Used for logging, auth, body parsing, error handling.

---

### **Q6. Difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?**

**A:**

* **CommonJS** ‚Üí `require()`, `module.exports`.
* **ESM** ‚Üí `import/export`. Modern standard, enabled with `"type": "module"`.

---

### **Q7. How do you scale Node.js apps?**

**A:** Use **clustering (PM2, cluster module)**, **load balancing (Nginx, HAProxy)**, **caching (Redis)**, **microservices**, and **message queues**.

---

### **Q8. What is Clustering in Node.js?**

**A:** Clustering spawns multiple Node processes across CPU cores, sharing the same server port. Improves scalability.

---

### **Q9. Difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?**

**A:**

* `process.nextTick()` runs **before** the next event loop phase.
* `setImmediate()` runs in the **check phase** (after I/O).

---

### **Q10. How do you handle errors in Node.js?**

**A:**

* Sync ‚Üí `try/catch`.
* Async ‚Üí `.catch()` or `try...catch` with async/await.
* Event emitters ‚Üí `error` event.
* Centralized Express error middleware.

---

### **Q11. How do you secure a Node.js app?**

**A:**

* **Helmet.js** (HTTP headers).
* **Input validation** (Joi, Zod).
* Prevent **XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection**.
* Use **rate limiting**, **CORS**, **JWT/OAuth2**.

---

### **Q12. What are some performance optimization techniques?**

**A:**

* Use **async I/O**, not blocking.
* **Streams** for large data.
* **Clustering + PM2**.
* **Compression, caching (Redis)**.
* Optimize DB queries & indexes.

---

### **Q13. Difference between Monolithic and Microservices architecture?**

**A:**

* **Monolith** ‚Üí single codebase, tightly coupled.
* **Microservices** ‚Üí multiple independent services, communicate via APIs/queues.

---

### **Q14. What are Message Queues in Node.js?**

**A:** Tools like **RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub** handle async tasks, event-driven workflows, and decouple services.

---

### **Q15. Explain JWT Authentication.**

**A:** JWT (JSON Web Token) is a **stateless token** containing user claims. Sent in headers, verified using secret/private key.

---

### **Q16. What is the difference between OAuth2 and JWT?**

**A:**

* **JWT** ‚Üí a token format.
* **OAuth2** ‚Üí an authorization protocol (can use JWTs internally).

---

### **Q17. What is CORS in Node.js?**

**A:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing ‚Üí controls which origins can access resources. Enabled via `cors` middleware in Express.

---

### **Q18. What are Worker Threads in Node.js?**

**A:** Module to run CPU-intensive tasks in parallel threads without blocking the main event loop.

---

### **Q19. Difference between fork, spawn, and exec?**

**A:**

* **spawn** ‚Üí child process with streaming output.
* **exec** ‚Üí child process with buffered output.
* **fork** ‚Üí specialized for Node child processes with IPC.

---

### **Q20. What is Pub/Sub in Redis?**

**A:** Publisher sends messages to channels, subscribers receive them. Used in **real-time apps (chat, notifications)**.

---

### **Q21. How does Node.js handle file I/O?**

**A:** Through **non-blocking async APIs** in `fs` module (`fs.promises.readFile`) and **streams** (`createReadStream`).

---

### **Q22. How do you test Node.js applications?**

**A:**

* Unit testing ‚Üí Jest, Mocha/Chai.
* API testing ‚Üí Supertest.
* End-to-end ‚Üí Cypress, Playwright.

---

### **Q23. What are some debugging tools in Node.js?**

**A:**

* Built-in inspector (`node --inspect`).
* Chrome DevTools.
* Logging with **Winston/Morgan**.
* Profiling with **Node Clinic, PM2 Monitoring**.

---

### **Q24. What is Serverless in Node.js?**

**A:** Running Node code in cloud-managed environments like **AWS Lambda, GCP Functions, Azure Functions**. No infra mgmt, pay per execution.

---

### **Q25. Difference between REST and GraphQL in Node.js?**

**A:**

* **REST** ‚Üí multiple endpoints, over-fetching possible.
* **GraphQL** ‚Üí single endpoint, clients query exactly what they need.

---

### **Q26. What is the role of package.json and package-lock.json?**

**A:**

* `package.json` ‚Üí project metadata, dependencies.
* `package-lock.json` ‚Üí exact dependency tree for reproducible installs.

---

### **Q27. What is Semantic Versioning (semver)?**

**A:** `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

* Major = breaking changes.
* Minor = backward-compatible features.
* Patch = bug fixes.

---

### **Q28. How do you prevent callback hell?**

**A:** Use **Promises** or **async/await** instead of nested callbacks.

---

### **Q29. What are some differences between Node.js and Laravel (PHP)?**

**A:**

* **Node.js** ‚Üí JS runtime, async non-blocking I/O, single-threaded.
* **Laravel** ‚Üí PHP framework, synchronous by default, multi-threaded requests.
* Node is better for **real-time apps**, Laravel good for **monoliths with ORM**.

---

### **Q30. When would you NOT use Node.js?**

**A:**

* CPU-heavy apps (ML training, video rendering).
* Apps requiring multithreading natively.
* Long-running tasks (better in background workers).

‚úÖ Now you‚Äôve got a **30-question Q\&A sheet** ‚Äî compact yet comprehensive enough for **interviews & revision**.

Do you want me to also create a **final one-page summary** (like a quick cheat sheet of diagrams + bullet points across all 18 sections)?
