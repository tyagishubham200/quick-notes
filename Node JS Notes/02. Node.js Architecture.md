Great 👍 Let’s move on to **2. Node.js Architecture**.
Since this is one of the **most asked interview topics**, I’ll break it down in **clear layers** with **developer-friendly notes** and **Q\&A points**.

# **2. Node.js Architecture**

### 📌 Overview

* Node.js is **single-threaded** but can handle **thousands of concurrent requests** due to its **event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture**.
* At its core:

  1. **V8 Engine** → Executes JavaScript.
  2. **libuv** → Handles async I/O operations.
  3. **Event Loop** → Manages request callbacks.

---

### 📌 Components of Node.js Architecture

1. **V8 Engine**

   * Developed by Google (used in Chrome).
   * Converts JavaScript → machine code.
   * Extremely fast due to Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

2. **Single Thread**

   * Node.js uses **one main thread** to handle requests.
   * Instead of blocking, it **delegates heavy I/O work** to background workers (via libuv).

3. **libuv**

   * A C++ library that provides **event loop + thread pool**.
   * Handles async tasks (file system, DNS, network, crypto).
   * Uses a **thread pool** (default: 4 threads) for heavy I/O tasks.

4. **Event Loop**

   * The “heart” of Node.js.
   * Continuously checks the **callback queue** and executes pending tasks.
   * Allows **non-blocking async execution**.

5. **Callback Queue**

   * Stores functions (callbacks) that need to be executed.
   * Example: After DB query finishes → its callback goes into queue → event loop picks it up.

6. **APIs / Async Operations**

   * Node.js delegates operations (like DB queries, file read/write) to **libuv**.
   * Once done → results are pushed to **callback queue** → processed by event loop.

### 📌 Node.js Request Lifecycle

1. Client sends a request (e.g., DB query, file read).
2. Node.js receives the request in **single thread**.
3. If **non-blocking I/O** → task is offloaded to **libuv** (background thread).
4. Once completed → callback placed in **callback queue**.
5. **Event loop** picks it and executes callback in main thread.

👉 This makes Node.js **asynchronous & scalable** without creating multiple threads for each request.

---

### 📌 Example: File Read

```js
const fs = require('fs');

console.log("Start");

// Non-blocking async read
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("File Content:", data);
});

console.log("End");
```

**Output (order matters):**

```
Start
End
File Content: Hello World
```

👉 Because `fs.readFile` is async → offloaded to libuv → event loop executes callback later.

---

### 📌 Where Multi-Threading Comes In

* Node.js itself is **single-threaded**.
* But **libuv’s thread pool** handles expensive operations (like file I/O, DNS, crypto).
* For **CPU-intensive work** → use:

  * **Worker Threads** (since Node 10.5+)
  * **Clustering** (multiple Node.js processes on multi-core CPU)

---

### 📌 Interview Q\&A

✅ **Q: Is Node.js single-threaded?**
👉 Yes, Node.js runs JavaScript in a single thread, but uses **libuv’s thread pool** for async tasks.

✅ **Q: What is the Event Loop?**
👉 A loop that continuously checks for pending callbacks/events and executes them → enables non-blocking I/O.

✅ **Q: How does Node.js handle multiple requests concurrently?**
👉 By offloading blocking tasks to **libuv thread pool**, while event loop continues processing other requests.

✅ **Q: Difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?**
👉 `process.nextTick()` runs **before next event loop iteration**; `setImmediate()` runs in the **next iteration** of event loop.

✅ **Q: How to handle CPU-heavy tasks in Node.js?**
👉 Use **Worker Threads** or **Cluster Mode** to distribute load.

---

### 📌 Key Takeaways

* Node.js = **single-threaded event-driven model**.
* Uses **libuv** for async I/O and background thread pool.
* **Event Loop** ensures non-blocking concurrency.
* Heavy CPU tasks → offload to **workers/clusters**.

👉 Next, we can move to **3. Core Modules in Node.js** (fs, http, path, os, events, stream).

Do you want me to explain **all core modules together** in one go, or should I break them into **separate small sections** (like `fs`, `http`, `stream` etc.)?
