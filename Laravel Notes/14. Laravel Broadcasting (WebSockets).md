# **14. Laravel Broadcasting (WebSockets)**  

Laravel Broadcasting allows real-time event broadcasting using WebSockets. It provides an easy way to push data from the server to the client without requiring continuous polling.

---

## **1. Why Use Broadcasting?**  

✅ Real-time notifications (e.g., chat applications, order status updates).  
✅ Live updates (e.g., stock prices, sports scores).  
✅ Synchronization between multiple clients (e.g., collaborative editing).  

---

## **2. Setting Up Broadcasting in Laravel**  

### **Step 1: Configure Broadcasting Driver**  
Laravel supports multiple drivers:  

- **log** (for debugging)  
- **pusher** (third-party WebSocket service)  
- **redis** (self-hosted, needs Laravel Echo Server)  
- **null** (disables broadcasting)  

Edit `.env`:  
```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher
```

Set Pusher credentials in `.env`:  
```env
PUSHER_APP_ID=your-app-id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your-app-key
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
PUSHER_HOST=
PUSHER_PORT=443
PUSHER_SCHEME=https
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1
```

### **Step 2: Install Required Packages**  
```bash
composer require pusher/pusher-php-server
npm install --save pusher-js
```

---

## **3. Creating and Broadcasting Events**  

### **Step 1: Generate an Event**  
```bash
php artisan make:event OrderShipped
```

### **Step 2: Define the Event Class**  
Modify `app/Events/OrderShipped.php`:  
```php
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\InteractsWithSockets;
use Illuminate\Broadcasting\PrivateChannel;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;
use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;

class OrderShipped implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    use InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

    public $orderId;

    public function __construct($orderId)
    {
        $this->orderId = $orderId;
    }

    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return new PrivateChannel('orders.'.$this->orderId);
    }

    public function broadcastAs()
    {
        return 'OrderShipped';
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Broadcasting Events**  

### **Fire the Event in a Controller**  
```php
use App\Events\OrderShipped;

public function shipOrder($orderId)
{
    event(new OrderShipped($orderId));
}
```

---

## **5. Listening for Events on Frontend (Laravel Echo)**  

### **Step 1: Install Laravel Echo & Pusher JS**
```bash
npm install --save laravel-echo pusher-js
```

### **Step 2: Configure Laravel Echo in `resources/js/bootstrap.js`**  
```js
import Echo from "laravel-echo";
import Pusher from "pusher-js";

window.Pusher = Pusher;

window.Echo = new Echo({
    broadcaster: 'pusher',
    key: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY,
    cluster: process.env.MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER,
    encrypted: true
});
```

### **Step 3: Listen to Events in a JavaScript File**  
```js
window.Echo.private(`orders.${orderId}`)
    .listen('.OrderShipped', (e) => {
        console.log('Order Shipped:', e);
    });
```

---

## **6. Private & Presence Channels**  

### **Private Channels (Authenticated Users Only)**  
Modify `app/Providers/BroadcastServiceProvider.php`:  
```php
Broadcast::channel('orders.{orderId}', function ($user, $orderId) {
    return $user->id === Order::find($orderId)->user_id;
});
```

### **Presence Channels (Track Online Users)**  
```php
Broadcast::channel('chat.{roomId}', function ($user) {
    return ['id' => $user->id, 'name' => $user->name];
});
```

---

## **7. Broadcasting with Redis & Laravel Echo Server (Self-Hosted)**  

### **Step 1: Install Redis & Laravel Echo Server**  
```bash
composer require predis/predis
npm install -g laravel-echo-server
```

### **Step 2: Configure Echo Server**  
```bash
laravel-echo-server init
```

Set `.env`:  
```env
BROADCAST_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
```

Run the server:  
```bash
laravel-echo-server start
```

---

## **8. Best Practices for Broadcasting**  

✅ Use **Pusher** for fast setup, but **Redis + Laravel Echo Server** for full control.  
✅ Use **Private Channels** for secure event broadcasting.  
✅ Optimize with **queueing** to prevent delays.  
✅ Load test WebSocket connections before production.
