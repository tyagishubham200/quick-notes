# **18. Microservices & Laravel Octane**  

Microservices architecture and Laravel Octane are powerful tools for building high-performance, scalable applications. This section covers both concepts in depth.

## **1. Understanding Microservices in Laravel**  

Microservices architecture involves breaking an application into small, independent services that communicate over APIs.

### **Key Benefits of Microservices**  
✅ **Scalability** – Services can be scaled independently.  
✅ **Flexibility** – Different services can be built using different technologies.  
✅ **Resilience** – Failure in one service doesn’t affect the entire system.  
✅ **Faster Development** – Teams can work on different services simultaneously.  

### **When to Use Microservices in Laravel?**  
- Large applications with independent modules (e.g., separate billing, authentication, and analytics services).  
- High-traffic applications that require **horizontal scaling**.  
- SaaS platforms that need **multi-tenancy** with independent services.

## **2. Building Microservices in Laravel**  

### **Step 1: Setting Up Laravel Microservices**  
- Create separate Laravel projects for each microservice.  
- Use RESTful APIs or GraphQL for communication.  
- Store configuration settings in `.env` and use `config()` for environment-based logic.  

### **Step 2: Service Communication**  

#### **a) REST API (Using Laravel Sanctum or Passport)**
```php
Route::get('/users/{id}', function ($id) {
    return User::findOrFail($id);
});
```

#### **b) gRPC for High Performance**
- Use **gRPC** (Google Remote Procedure Call) for faster communication.  
- Install the `spiral/php-grpc` package for Laravel support.  

#### **c) Event-Driven Communication (Using Laravel Events & Queues)**
- Instead of direct API calls, services can publish events to a **message queue** (RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka).  
```php
event(new UserRegistered($user));
```

---

## **3. Authentication & Authorization in Microservices**  
- Use **Laravel Passport or JWT** for secure token-based authentication.  
- Implement an **API Gateway** for centralized authentication.  

Example JWT Authentication:
```php
use Firebase\JWT\JWT;

$token = JWT::encode(['user_id' => 1], env('JWT_SECRET'), 'HS256');
```

## **4. Introduction to Laravel Octane**  

Laravel Octane boosts performance by **removing the need to reload the framework on every request**. It runs applications using **Swoole or RoadRunner**, making Laravel suitable for high-performance applications.  

### **Benefits of Laravel Octane**  
🚀 **Super Fast** – Handles thousands of requests per second.  
🔄 **Persistent Memory** – Avoids repeated bootstrapping of the Laravel app.  
⚡ **Concurrency** – Supports multiple requests at once.

## **5. Setting Up Laravel Octane**  

### **Step 1: Install Laravel Octane**  
```bash
composer require laravel/octane
```

### **Step 2: Choose a Server (Swoole or RoadRunner)**  
```bash
php artisan octane:install
```
Choose **Swoole** for WebSockets and real-time applications or **RoadRunner** for task processing.

### **Step 3: Start the Octane Server**  
```bash
php artisan octane:start
```

## **6. Optimizing Laravel with Octane**  

### **1️⃣ Enable Cache for Database Queries**  
```php
Cache::remember('users', 60, function () {
    return User::all();
});
```

### **2️⃣ Use Workers for Background Tasks**  
```php
Octane::tick('email-notification', function () {
    Notification::send(User::all(), new DailySummary());
});
```

### **3️⃣ Optimize Middleware for Performance**  
Disable session middleware for API routes:
```php
Route::middleware(['api', 'throttle:60,1'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/data', [DataController::class, 'index']);
});
```

## **7. Best Practices for Laravel Microservices & Octane**  
✅ Use **API Gateways** for routing traffic efficiently.  
✅ Implement **Redis or Kafka** for asynchronous event handling.  
✅ Avoid **global state in Octane** – always reset variables in each request.  
✅ Use **Octane Workers** for background tasks instead of Jobs when possible.  
✅ Optimize **database queries** with caching and indexing.  
✅ Scale **horizontally** by running multiple instances of microservices.
